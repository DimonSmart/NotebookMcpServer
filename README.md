### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy by Design
**Important:** There is intentionally **no** "list all notebooks" function. This ensures that different projects cannot interfere with each other's data. However, if you know a notebook name, you can share it between projects securely.

## Data Storage Format

Each notebook is stored as a single JSON file in your storage directory. The structure is simple and human-readable:

```json
{
  "description": "My project notes",
  "pages": {
    "page-name-1": "Content of first page...",
    "page-name-2": "Content of second page...",
    "meeting-notes": "Notes from today's meeting..."
  }
}
```

Page names serve as keys, and page text is stored as values. This format makes it easy to backup, version control, or manually edit your notebooks if needed.

## Compatibility & Integration

Works with any **MCP client** that supports stdio tool execution, including:
- Claude Desktop
- VS Code Copilot extensions
- Custom LLM agents
- IDE assistants
- AI workflow tools

Perfect as a lightweight, local memory system alongside Copilot-style assistants.
